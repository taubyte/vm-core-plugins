# Taubyte VM Core Plugins

This repository is the home for the core feature implementations used in the Taubyte WebAssembly Virtual Machine. A significant part of the functionalities offered by this repository demands direct node access, whereas other portions were established before we rolled out our plugin system, [Orbit](https://github.com/taubyte/vm-orbit). Consequently, unless you explicitly need direct access to the Taubyte node, we advise using [Orbit](https://github.com/taubyte/vm-orbit) which executes your plugin as a separate process, thereby improving reliability and security.
